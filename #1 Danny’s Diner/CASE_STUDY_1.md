## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

## Question and Solution

### Creating the schema:
````sql
CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
use dannys_diner;

CREATE TABLE sales (
  customer_id VARCHAR(1),
  order_date DATE,
  product_id INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  (customer_id, order_date, product_id)
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),

  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
 

CREATE TABLE menu (
  product_id INTEGER,
  product_name VARCHAR(5),
  price INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  customer_id VARCHAR(1),
  join_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  (customer_id, join_date)
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
